<p>If improperly used, an inheritance becomes a bounty on your head. It is important that the person who will recieve your inheritance is unsure of whether they will recieve anything at all.</p>
<p>Another problem that can come up with inheritance is that you and your decendent die together</p>
<p>The way to solve these problems is to have a list of 2 or more people who all have the potential to get your inheritance. For example, if you want to set your inheritance to unlock 1 year in the future, and there are 3 people on your list of who can inherit the money Alice, Bob, Carol.
  </p>
<p>  Let the money unlock for Alice in 365 days. If Alice fails to unlock the money, then 5 days later Bob has the potential to take the money. If Bob doesn't take the money, then 5 days later Carol should have the potential to take the money.</p>
<p>  Don't tell Alice, Bob, or Carol who the other possible inheriters are. Don't tell them the order of the list. Don't let Alice know she is first, don't let Bob know he is second, don't let Carol know she is third. Tell them that you have a list of possible inheriters, but don't tell them who is on the list. </p>
